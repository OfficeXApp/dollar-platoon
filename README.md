## What is a SKILL.md?

A SKILL.md is a structured documentation file that AI agents (like Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) can consume to understand how to interact with an app's API. It enables AI-assisted workflows — users can ask their AI agent to perform actions on their behalf, and the agent uses the SKILL.md as its instruction manual.

## Usage

Copy the contents of [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md) into your AI agent's context, or point your agent to this repository.
