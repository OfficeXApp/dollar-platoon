## What is a SKILL.md?

A SKILL.md is a structured documentation file that AI agents (like Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) can consume to understand how to interact with an app's API. It enables AI-assisted workflows — users can ask their AI agent to perform actions on their behalf, and the agent uses the SKILL.md as its instruction manual.

## Usage
